# Traffic Signal Violation Detection System

## Overview

This project leverages Computer Vision and YOLOv8 to identify vehicles violating traffic signals with high precision. By using a custom-trained YOLOv8 model, the system accurately detects red light violations. Once a violation is detected, the system captures the vehicle's number plate, retrieves the registration number, and generates an automated challan based on the database of vehicle registrations. TensorFlow and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are used to process and analyze traffic footage, aiding law enforcement and traffic management.

## Project Goals

- Enhance traffic management.
- Support law enforcement by accurately identifying vehicles that violate traffic signals.
- Automatically generate and issue challans for offending vehicles.

## Process

1. **Detection of Traffic Violations**:
   - Utilize a YOLOv8 model trained on a custom vehicle dataset to detect red light violations.
   - Detect when a vehicle crosses predetermined virtual lines at a traffic signal.

2. **Number Plate Recognition**:
   - Capture the number plate of the violating vehicle.
   - Use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) within TensorFlow to process and recognize the registration number from the captured images.

3. **Challan Generation**:
   - Retrieve the vehicle's registration details from a database.
   - Automatically generate and issue a challan (traffic ticket) to the vehicle owner.

## Features

- **High Precision Detection**: Custom-trained YOLOv8 model for accurate detection of red light violations.
- **Automated Number Plate Recognition**: CNNs in TensorFlow enable reliable reading of number plates from traffic footage.
- **Seamless Integration**: Efficient processing of traffic footage through the integration of TensorFlow with detection and recognition modules.
- **Automated Challan Issuance**: Streamlined enforcement process by automatically generating and issuing challans based on retrieved registration data.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Jasmit7/Drishti/
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd traffic-violation-detection
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Train the YOLOv8 model on your custom vehicle dataset:
    ```python
    # Code for training the model
    ```

2. Run the traffic violation detection system:
    ```python
    # Code to start the detection system
    ```

3. The system will automatically process the traffic footage, detect red light violations, capture number plates, and issue challans.
